# 👋 Hi, I'm Ryan LeCours

I’m a software engineer based in Bellingham, WA, focused on building performant, scalable web applications with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js** and **GraphQL**.

- 💻 **Currently:** Software Engineer III at **DCS Corp**, where I build flight-planning and geospatial UI systems in a **TypeScript monorepo** (NX + Yarn Workspaces). I lead frontend architecture, mentor developers, and drive high code coverage and reusable design patterns across multiple teams.  
- 🌲 **On the side:** Building **[LoamLogger](https://loamlogger.app)** — a mountain-bike-focused ride tracking app built with **React**, **Node.js**, **GraphQL**, and **PostgreSQL**, integrating **Garmin API** data for performance and gear analytics.  
- 🧭 **What I enjoy:** Clean system design, an intuitive developer experience, and projects that connect tech with the outdoors.  
- ⚡ **Tech stack:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, NX, Tailwind, Jest, and Vercel/Railway for deployment.
